# Pathfinder 2E Actions

Injection of the Pathfinder 2E icons for Action, Double Action, Triple Action, Free Action e Reaction.

# Usage

Place a code block with the type of action that you want (eg. `pf2:2` for a Double Action) and it will be replaced by the icon in view and live preview.

## Fantasy Statblocks

If the property is configured to be `rendered as Markdown` you can add the code block with the action in the text and it will be replaced with the icon.

# Inspiration

This plugin was stringly inspired in the [Dice Roller Plugin](https://github.com/javalent/dice-roller), by Javalent. And by the [PF2 Action Icons](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/ObsidianTTRPGShare/tree/main/Pathfinder/2E/action-icons) documentation of the [Obsidian TTRPG Community](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community).
